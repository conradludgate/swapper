# swapper
A game that involves swapping numbers. This was a game I made back in 2013 but I am now remaking

## How to install
Have go installed on your system, then run

`go get -u github.com/conradludgate/swapper`

in a console

## How to play
Ensure that your GOPATH/bin is in your path, then run 
`swapper` in a console to start a game

Choose your difficulty and game size, I recommence Easy and size 5 to get started

The aim is to get the tiles into the arrangement that it displays, in this case, 
get the numbers in increasing order

You have the option to swap tiles, if you select a tile by it's location (the number above the tile), it'll turn yellow and available moves will be red.

Swaps are only available if the distance between the tiles is equal to one of the tile's value.

That's it. Try it out, have fun and good luck, it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it.
